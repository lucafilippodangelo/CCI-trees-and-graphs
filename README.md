# Trees and Graphs

## 4.1 Routes Between Nodes
Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a route between two nodes.

SOLUTION:
It's an implemetation of a BFS(Breadth First Search), the problem can be solved with just a simple graphs traversal. We start with one node and check if the other node is found. We have to mark nodes as already visited.
